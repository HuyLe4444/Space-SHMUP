## Project Overview
Mission Demolition is an engaging physics-based game where players must strategically launch projectiles to demolish structures. This project demonstrates the application of Unity physics, scene management, and difficulty scaling in game development.

## Features
- Physics-based demolition gameplay
- Multiple difficulty levels (Easy, Normal, Hard)
- Score tracking and UI integration

## How to Play

### Installation
1. Navigate to the Build Game folder in the project directory.
2. Locate and run the "My project.exe" file to launch the game.

### Gameplay
- Use the slingshot mechanism to aim and launch projectiles.
- Your goal is to demolish the target structures using the least number of shots possible.
- Progress through increasingly challenging levels.

### Game Modes
We've implemented three difficulty levels to cater to different player skills and preferences:

1. Easy Mode: 5 shots available per level, ideal for beginners or casual play.
2. Normal Mode: 3 shots available, offering a balanced challenge.
3. Hard Mode: Only 1 shot available, perfect for players seeking an intense challenge.

Choose your preferred difficulty at the start of the game to tailor your experience.

## Development Notes
- Developed using Unity (version 2022.3.46f1)
- C# scripting for game logic and mechanics
- Utilizes Unity's built-in physics engine for realistic demolition effects
